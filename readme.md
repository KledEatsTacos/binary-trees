# Linked List Tree Operations

This is my second homework for my Data Structures class. The program reads data from a file, creates nodes in a linked list, and allows various operations on these nodes.

## Features
- **Add Nodes**: Read data from `agaclar.txt` and create nodes in a linked list.
- **Display Nodes**: Display all nodes in the linked list.
- **User Commands**:
  - **a**: Move to the previous node.
  - **d**: Move to the next node.
  - **s**: Delete the current node.
  - **w**: Mirror the tree structure of the current node.
  - **q**: Quit the program.

## How to Use
1. Place the `agaclar.txt` file in the same directory as the executable.
2. Run the program to load the data and display the nodes.
3. Use the user commands to navigate and manipulate the nodes.

## Notes
- Ensure the `agaclar.txt` file is in the same directory as the executable.
- This project was made with my blood, tears and sweat. and I am glad it is done.
