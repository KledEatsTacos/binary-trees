This is my second homework for my Data Structures class.

The program will read the text in agaclar.txt and each line will be represented as a tree.
the program will show the way the trees are drawn, and show their current address, the tree's value, and the next tree's address.

while calculating the tree value, each character's ASCII value will be taken. if the node is a left node, its value will be multiplied by two. if its the root or right node, its value will be as it is.

value = 2 * (sum of left nodes) + (sum of right nodes)

The user will be able to go through each tree using A and D buttons. in addition, pressing S will delete the current tree, pressing W will mirror the way the tree looks, as in the left nodes become right nodes and vice versa.



I will include comments to make my life, my professor's life, and the lives of GitHub users easier.
